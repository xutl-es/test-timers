# @xutl/test-timers

One [eXtremely Useful Tool Library](https://xutl.es) useful for testing, when timers should be intercepted and manually advanced. This also overrides Date to always be in accord with what the time should be according to this library

## Install

```bash
npm install --save-dev @xutl/test-timers
```

## Usage

Load and initialize the global environmet.

```bash
node -r @xutl/test-timers my-test.js
```

```typescript
import * as Timer from '@xutl/queue';

// the exported set/clear functions are the original ones that work of system timing;
// Date is also overriden with the original exported

Date.now(); // initially this will be accurate
Timers.initialize(Date.now() - 5000); // set the current time back by 5 seconds, after which Date.now() will lag
Timer.setInterval(() => Timer.bump(5), 10); // bump the time every 10ms by 9ms (which could)
Timer.setinterval(() => Timer.update(Date.now()), 5000); // bring the time up to reality every 5seconds

Date.now(); // will be lagged
setInterval(() => console.log(Date.now()));
/*
Date.now() will initally be lagged,
but after 5seconds it will be up to speed;
just to slowly fall behind again;
but then be brought current again.
*/
```
